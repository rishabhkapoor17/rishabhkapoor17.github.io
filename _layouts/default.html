  <h3>Activities</h3>
  <h2>Phi Chi Theta</h2>
	<p>Phi Chi Theta is a professional business fraternity on campus at Rutgers! We've consistently had the top GPA among business fraternities on campus, and are involved all around Rutgers activities including community service, corporate company events, job fairs, and work to actively support the LUPUS foundation! I've served as Treasurer of Phi Chi Theta from 2018 through 2019, where I worked to maintain the fraternity's budget, effectively create fundraising events to raise $5,000 yearly, and supervise a team of directors. My position concluded in an amassment of $12,000 since taking the position.</p>   

<h2>Rutgers Dance Marathon</h2>
	<p> Rutgers Dance Marathon is Rutgers' largest student organized philanthropic organization. We donate upwards of $1 million every year to the Embrace Kids Foundation through a 24 hour "dance" event which brings the Rutgers- New Brunswick family together. I have been an active participant in Rutgers Dance Marathon since 2018 and had the position of captain this year. I helped to organize the overall planning of the event this year as a member of the Dancer Relations team. We organized participants into teams and planned events for them to do at the marathon!</p>

<h2>Dance</h2>
	<p> I have been involved in dance ever since middle school and have joined different organizations since. At Rutgers, I was part of Rutgers Performing Dance Company and most recently Verse One, a begginer-mid hip hop team! We showcased in competitions at NJIT as well as local performances on campus.</p>

<h2>TEDxRutgers</h2>
	<p> TEDxRutgers creates a TED conference that Rutgers kids can participate in on campus by contacting esteemed inviduals around the country. I served on the Marketing Committee for Rutgers where we helped promote and create hype for the event. We sold out of tickets!</p>
	
<h2>Google Community Leaders Program</h2>
	<p> Google CLP is a program on campus which helps non-profit orgs and children in New Brunswick schools use the several Google Ad Grants and Ad Words technologies, as well as become accustomed to new tech. I was on the NGO committe which involved working with several New Brunswick non-profits to help them apply for grants and advertise on Google!</p>
	
<h2>Residence Life</h2>
	<p> I've been interested in Rutgers Residence Life since freshman year, when I was an Event Coordinator for my hall. I will be a Resident Assistant next year!</P>
